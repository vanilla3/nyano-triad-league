# Project-scoped Codex configuration for this repository.
#
# Codex reads `.codex/config.toml` inside trusted projects and layers them from repo root to CWD.
# Keep this file free of secrets.

# Default model for this repo (can be overridden from CLI with --model)
model = "gpt-5.3-codex"

# Safer default: ask for approval when running commands or editing files unless explicitly set otherwise.
# Other common values: "never", "untrusted"
approval_policy = "on-request"

# Allow slightly larger project guidance if you later split AGENTS.md across directories.
